# Breast-Cancer-Prediction_using-Streamlit

*Problem Statement:*
In the proposed system we plan on using existing data of breast cancer patients 
which has been collected for a number of years and run different machine 
learning algorithms on them. We will create an interactive web dashboard
where these algorithms will analyse the data from the datasets to predict 
whether the patient has breast cancer or not and it will also tell us if the cancer 
is malignant or benign. 
It is done by taking the patient’s data and mapping it with the dataset and 
checking whether there are any patterns found with the data. If a patient has 
breast cancer, then instead of taking more tests to check whether the cancer is 
malignant or benign, ML can be used to predict the case based on the huge 
amount of data on breast cancer.
This proposed system helps the patients as it reduces the amount of money they need to spend just for the diagnosis. Also, if 
the tumour is benign, then it is not cancerous, and the patient doesn’t need to go 
through any of the other tests. This saves a lot of time as well.

*The dataset contains these features:*
radius,texture,perimeter,area,smoothness,compactness,concavity,concave points,symmetry,fractal dimension

*Algorithms Used:*
1. Logistic Regression
2. K Nearest Neighbour
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Random Forest
5. Gradient Boosting
